# expense-tracker-streamlit
This project is a simple and interactive Expense Tracker Web Application built with Python, Streamlit, Pandas, and Matplotlib. The application allows users to record daily expenses, organize them by category, and visualize spending patterns through charts. It provides an easy-to-use interface where users can input expenses and immediately see summaries of their spending habits.

The main features of the application include the ability to add new expenses with details such as date, category, and amount, view summaries of expenses grouped by category, and visualize the results with pie charts and bar charts. Users can also filter expenses by month to better understand their financial habits over time.

The project is implemented using Streamlit for the web interface, Pandas for managing and analyzing data, and Matplotlib for generating visualizations. The application automatically creates and updates a CSV file (expenses.csv) to store all expenses entered by the user.

To run the project locally, you need to clone the repository, install the required dependencies, and then start the Streamlit server. After running the command streamlit run expense_tracker.py, the app will launch in your browser at http://localhost:8501. The repository also includes a requirements.txt file that specifies the dependencies needed for smooth execution.

The project is suitable for deployment on Streamlit Cloud, which allows you to host the application online for free. By pushing the code to a GitHub repository and connecting it with Streamlit Cloud, you can generate a public link to share the app with others as part of your portfolio.

This Expense Tracker project demonstrates practical skills in Python programming, data handling, and web app development with Streamlit. It can serve as a foundation for more advanced applications by integrating cloud databases, adding user authentication, or enhancing the interface for mobile compatibility.
